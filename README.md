Miscellaneous utilities used by other repos
===========================================
Simple small file containing various low (library) footprint dependencies.

This contains a library for helping with
* Spreadsheets (CSV and Excel)
* Zip files/streams

Obtaining
---------
In your `project.clj` file, add:

[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.tools/misc/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.tools/misc/)

Documentation
-------------
Additional [documentation](https://plandes.github.io/clj-tools-misc/codox/index.html).

Usage
-----
Create a spreadsheet with all column adjusted to largest size of largest cell
and make a stylized header.
```clojure
user=> (require '[clj-excel.core :as excel])
user=> (require '[zensols.util.spreadsheet :as ss])
user=> (-> (excel/build-workbook
            (excel/workbook-hssf)
            {"Animal Stats"
             (-> [["Animal" "Really Big Col" "Size"]
                  ["cat" 1 "small"]
                  ["dog" 0 "big"]]
                 (ss/headerize))})
           (ss/autosize-columns)
           (excel/save (res/resource-path :analysis-report "test.xls")))
user=> (-> (clojure.java.io/file "test.xls")
		   ss/excel-or-csv-by-columns
		   pprint)
(("Animal" "Really Big Col" "Size")
 ("cat" 1.0 "small")
 ("dog" 0.0 "big"))
```

Building
--------
All [leiningen](http://leiningen.org) tasks will work in this project.  For
additional build functionality (git tag convenience utility functionality)
clone the [Clojure build repo](https://github.com/plandes/clj-zenbuild) in the
same (parent of this file) directory as this project:
```bash
   cd ..
   git clone https://github.com/plandes/clj-zenbuild
```
